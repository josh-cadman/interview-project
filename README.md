Interview Task (20/10/2025)

- Please fork this repository, and commit all changes you make
- Please do not spend ages on this task (3h or less!) - it's a quick turn around, and the purpose is simply to get some code you've written that you're proud of to explain during the second intervew.
- The attached "sqlite" database file and ".env" may be used - but any database schema changes should be included in migrations and/or seeders if necessary to demonstrate as I will not reimport databases to test. 

Task:
- Implement any feature of your choosing onto this codebase of the project that we worked with during the interview
- You will be asked to explan:

1. Why you chose the feature you did 
2. How long you spent to add the code you added
3. What your feature does and how it works (and **why** it works!)
4. The technical design decisions you made while implementing the feature.

Submission deadline: 9am on Thursday 23rd
